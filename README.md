# Web Programming Step by Step
## Assignment: Remember the Cow (To-Do List)
### Description
In this assignment you will write a small yet complete "Web 2.0" application that includes user login sessions.

You will create a web page for a fictional online to-do list site called "Remember the Cow", which is a parody of the real to-do list web site "Remember the Milk". Your site requires the user to log in first. After logging in, the user can view his/her to-do list.

You will write and turn in the following files:


* **top.html** and bottom.html, files holding HTML content shared by several of your web pages
* **cow.css**, the style sheet describing the appearance of all of your web pages
* **index.php**, the front web page describing the site and containing a form for the user to log in
* **login.php**, the target where index.php submits its login form data to log the user in
* **logout.php**, logs the user out and returns them to the front page index.php
* **todolist.php**, the PHP web service for remembering the state of the to-do list
* **shared.php**, a PHP file containing any shared PHP code or functions used by multiple other files
On the course web site we have provided a skeleton of the HTML output from index.php and todolist.php, to help you get started. The HTML given should not necessarily stay in those files exactly as written (e.g., it might go into one of the "common" files), but it is an indication of what the output should be. You don't have to produce exactly the same HTML output as in these skeletons, but they can serve as a starting point.
